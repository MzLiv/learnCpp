/*
Write a single - file program(named main.cpp) that reads two separate integers from the user, adds them together, 
and then outputs the answer.The program should use three functions :

A function named “readNumber” should be used to get(and return) a single integer from the user.
A function named “writeAnswer” should be used to output the answer.This function should take a single parameterand 
have no return value.
A main() function should be used to glue the above functions together.
